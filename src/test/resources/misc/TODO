Apparently, there is some conflict between the JUnit Surefire provider and the JUnit support in the Surefire 2.22.0 plugin release.

JUnit5 tests did not run until we added the following to the pom.xml
Usually no need to add the following because spring boot configures maven-surefire-plugin
However to overcome the above issue we have to add it
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.22.2</version>
            </plugin>
